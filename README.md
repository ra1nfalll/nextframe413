# CSC413 Project: Predict next frames in a video using Neural Nets

## Introduction
This project will work on the next frame prediction problem. Next frame prediction is an unsupervised machine learning task to predict the next image frame given a sequence of past frames as input. This involves recognizing objects spatially in an image and their temporal relationships across past frames, which can be interpreted as the subtasks to the next frame prediction problem.
 
## How to use?

### Data Loading
Please follow the following steps before running the main notebook to make sure the data is loaded correctly. We are using kaggle to load the data directly:
Reference: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/how-to-load-kaggle-datasets-directly-into-google-colab/

1. Login to your kaggle account and navigate to your account settings and download an API token, on to your computer as shown in the picture.

2. Next, upload this API token file on to the notebook by going over here. This is your main secret file, don't let anyone else have access to this.

3. Now run the first cell in the notebook and this should connect to the kaggle database and download our dataset that we will use.
